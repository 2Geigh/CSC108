SEARCH ALGORITHMS:
	Linear Search: compares values in list one-by-one to find first index
		Runtime n
	Binary Search: repeatedly divides list in half by comparison with search argument
		Runtime log(n)
		List must be sorted

SORTING ALGORITHMS:
	Bubble Sort: Goes through the list comparing pairs and swapping them if they're not sorted, letting large values bubble to the end
		Runtime O(n^2)
	Selection Sort: Repeatedly iterates over list to find smallest value, then swaps it with the first value, then repeating over a smaller subsection
		Runtime n^2
	Insertion Sort: Inserts values into a new sorted portion of the list by comparing the value to the portion
		Runtime n^2
